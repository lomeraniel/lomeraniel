### Hi, I'm Elena Dosil

I started my coding career just after university during my first job as Project Engineer where I had to program AMX and Crestron Control Systems to automate and control several aspects of videoconference rooms. I later fell in love with WordPress and how it helped democratize the web. I'm very much interested in front-end development, but I find myself more comfortable with the backend. Learning is one of my passions, and I'm currently working my way through a Full-Stack Engineering course.
